## About

This project is showing how you can use C#, within TDD environment to solve the problem of allocating seats to customers who have bought 1/2/3 tickets for a particular movie theatre.  The role of the customer here will be played out by a random number generator which assigns between 1 and 3 tickets. The seating in the threatre is 3 rows of 5 seats where A1 is to be allocated to the first purchased ticket holder.

The design is such that the Cinnamon Cinemas movie theatre manager wants to allocate seats to customers so that he can control reserved seating for the theatre.

- GIVEN a customer wants to request some tickets
- WHEN they request a number of seats between 1 and 3 for a movie
- THEN the customer should be allocated the required number of seats from the available seats on the seating plan
- AND the seats should be recorded as allocated
